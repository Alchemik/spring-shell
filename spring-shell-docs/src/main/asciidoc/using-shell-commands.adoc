=== Commands
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

In this section we go through an actual command registration and leave command options
and execution later in a documentation. More detailed info can be found from
<<appendix-tech-intro-registration>>.

There are two different ways to define a command. Firstly through an annotation model and
secondly through programmatic model. Annotation model if where you define your methods
in a class and annotate class and methods with a spesific annotations. Programmatic model
is where things are done on a more low level ways by defining command registrations either
as beans or registering those with a command catalog dynamically.
