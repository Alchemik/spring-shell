When using <<using-shell-components-ui>> to build something which involves
use of a multiple components your implemention may become a bit cluttered.
Nothing wrong with that but to ease these use cases we've build a
`ComponentFlow` which is able to hook multiple component executions together
as a _flow_.

Here is some examples of a flows and what it looks like in a shell:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/FlowComponentSnippets.java[tag=snippet1]
----
====

image::images/component-flow-showcase-1.svg[text input]


====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/FlowComponentSnippets.java[tag=snippet2]
----
====

image::images/component-flow-conditional-1.svg[text input]

Results from running a flow returns `ComponentFlowResult` which you can
use to do furher actions.
