===== Component Render
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

There are two ways to implement component rendering, firstly fully
programmatically or secondly using a _ANTLR Stringtemplate_. Though
strictly speaking there is just a simple `Function` renderer interface
which takes `Context` as an input and outputs a list of `AttributedString`
but this allows to choose between _templating_ and _code_.

Templating is a good choice if you don't need to anything complex or
you just want to slightly modify existing component layouts. Rendering
via code then gives you flexibility to do whatever you need.

Programmatic way to render is simple as to create a `Function`:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/UiComponentSnippets.java[tag=snippet1]
----
====

And then hook it with a component:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/UiComponentSnippets.java[tag=snippet2]
----
====

Component have their own context but usually shares some functionality
from a parent component types, those context variables are shown below.
