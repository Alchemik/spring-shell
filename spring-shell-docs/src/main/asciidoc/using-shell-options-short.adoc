Short style _POSIX_ option in most is just a synonym to long format but
adds additional feature to combine those options together. Having short
options _a_, _b_, _c_ can be used as `-abc`.

Programmatically short option is defined by using short name function.

which means type is a _boolean_. That way you can define a presense of a flags
