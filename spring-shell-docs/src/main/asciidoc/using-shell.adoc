== Using Spring Shell
This section describes how to use Spring Shell.

[IMPORTANT]
====
_Spring Shell 2.1.x_ is a major rework to bring codebase up-to-date with
existing _Spring Boot_ versions, adding new features and especially
making it work with _GraalVM_ which makes command-line applications much
more relevant on a java space. Moving to new major version also allows
us to clean up codebase and make some needed breaking changes.
